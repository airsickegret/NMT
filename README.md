# NMT - NIMH Macaque Template

## Description
The NMT is an anatomical structural MRI template of the macaque brain. It was created using the freely available software package [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/). The NMT is technically the non-linear diffeomorphic average of 31 adult rhesus macaque brains, generated by iterativley registering and averageing each individual subject to a common space. For more information on the template creation process, see [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910012061).

This README file provides an overview of the NMT MRI volume and its associated volume and surface files. Sample commands for visualizing the surfaces are listed as well, using [SUMA](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/suma) from the [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov) software suite. 

## Download

To download from the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store the NMT repository. Then, copy and paste this command:
```bash
git clone http://github.com/jms290/NMT.git
```

Otherwise, click the green button "clone or download" on the NMT page...

## List of NMT files

All volume and surface files are stored in the relatively universal Nifti (.nii.gz) and Gifti (.gii) formats, to be compatible with a plethora of software packages. 

- NMT volume (with skull) - **NMT.nii.gz**
- NMT brain mask - **NMT_brain-mask.nii.gz**
- NMT probabilisitic tissue segmentation masks
	+ Gray matter - **NMT_segmentation_GM.nii.gz**
	+ White matter - **NMT_segmentation_WM.nii.gz**
	+ Cerebral spinal fluid - **NMT_segmentation_CSF.nii.gz**
- NMT 3-tissue segmentation mask (combination of 50% thresholded probabilistic masks) - **NMT_segmentation.nii.gz**
- NMT surfaces
	+ Gray matter surface - **[lh or rh].GM.gii**
	+ White matter surface - **[lh or rh].WM.gii**
	+ Mid-cortical surface - **[lh or rh].mid.gii**
- NMT surfaces (inflated)
	+ Gray matter surface - **[lh or rh].GM_inflated.gii**
	+ White matter surface - **[lh or rh].WM_inflated.gii**
	+ Mid-cortical surface - **[lh or rh].mid_inflated.gii**
