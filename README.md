# NMT - NIMH Macaque Template

## Description
The NMT is an anatomical structural MRI template of the macaque brain. It was created using the freely available software package [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/). The NMT is technically the non-linear diffeomorphic average of 31 adult rhesus macaque brains, generated by iterativley registering and averageing each individual subject to a common space. For more information on the template creation process, see [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910012061). 

This README file provides an overview of the NMT MRI volume and its associated volume and surface files. Sample commands for visualization are listed as well, using the [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov) software suite.
